var is used throughut a program

let is only used within a scope.

const can never change. Change the variables
Objects: var ourDog {
		"name": "Camper",
		"age": 4,
		"tails": 1,
}

converting switch statements to objrcts.

var secondTree = myPlants[1].list[1]; : The "1" is for the one in an array while the dot notation is for the object. You 
can also use bracket notation

var myArray = [];

For checking the total in an array, using for loop;

var ourArr = [9, 10, 11, 12];
var ourTotal = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < ourArr.length; i++) {
	ourTotal += ourArr[i];
}

console.log(ourTotal);

while loop first checks the condition before it runs the code
A do-while loop runs the code at least once and then check the condition.

 Exercise: You have lists of names and properties,you creeate a variable where u pass in a name and
 it will give you the valuable for the property.
